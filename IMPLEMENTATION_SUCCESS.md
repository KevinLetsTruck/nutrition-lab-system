## **🚀 READY FOR IMMEDIATE USE**

### **API Endpoint - LIVE and OPERATIONAL**
```
GET /api/simple-assessment/cmeqkgj79003xv2uk4imjs3il/condition-scores
```

**Sample Response** (Top 3 Conditions):
```json
{
  "conditionScores": [
    {
      "condition": "digestive", 
      "percentage": "72.00",
      "priority_rank": 1,
      "severity_level": "HIGH"
    },
    {
      "condition": "sleep",
      "percentage": "71.43", 
      "priority_rank": 2,
      "severity_level": "HIGH"
    },
    {
      "condition": "cardiovascular",
      "percentage": "66.67",
      "priority_rank": 3, 
      "severity_level": "MODERATE"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Immediate Practitioner Value**
- **Clinical Priority**: Digestive (72%) and Sleep (71%) require immediate intervention
- **Treatment Focus**: Address top 2 HIGH severity conditions first
- **Progress Tracking**: Recalculate scores after interventions to measure improvement

## **🔧 TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **Database Layer**
```sql
✅ ConditionScores table with 20 records (4 assessments × 8 conditions average)
✅ calculate_condition_scores() function for real-time scoring
✅ assessment_condition_summary view for practitioner dashboards
✅ Proper indexing and foreign key constraints
```

### **API Layer**
```typescript
✅ GET endpoint: Retrieve condition scores with clinical recommendations
✅ POST endpoint: Recalculate scores for updated assessments
✅ Error handling: 404 for missing assessments, 500 for system errors
✅ Clinical recommendations: Automated based on condition percentages
```

### **Scoring Algorithm**
```
✅ Formula: (Sum of Response Scores / (Question Count × 5)) × 100
✅ Range: 0-100% for each functional medicine condition
✅ Classification: HIGH (70%+), MODERATE (50-69%), LOW (<50%)
✅ Precision: 2 decimal places for clinical accuracy
```
