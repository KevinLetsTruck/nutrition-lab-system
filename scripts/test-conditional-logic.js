üß™ Testing Conditional Logic Fix
================================

1. Open your browser to: http://localhost:3000/test-complete-flow
2. Open DevTools Console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Watch for these console logs:

When you answer questions:
- üíæ Saving response for [question-id]: "[your-answer]"
- YES_NO answer changed to: "[yes/no]"

When checking conditional logic:
- üîç Checking conditional for essential-food-list:
-    Depends on: essential-food-sensitivities
-    Show if: yes
-    Response value: [your answer]
-    Normalized comparison: "[your answer]" === "yes" = [true/false]
- ‚úÖ Showing or ‚ùå Skipping

4. Test the food sensitivity question:
   - Answer "No" ‚Üí Food list should be SKIPPED
   - Answer "Yes" ‚Üí Food list should APPEAR

Expected Console Output for "No":
=================================
üíæ Saving response for essential-food-sensitivities: "no"
üîç Checking conditional for essential-food-list:
   Depends on: essential-food-sensitivities
   Show if: yes
   Found response: {questionId: "essential-food-sensitivities", value: "no"}
   Response value: no
   Normalized comparison: "no" === "yes" = false
‚ùå Skipping essential-food-list
‚û°Ô∏è Moving to question: essential-chronic-conditions
