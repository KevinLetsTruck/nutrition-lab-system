# Assessment Module Order

## Current Module Sequence

1. **SCREENING** - Universal screening questions to identify primary concerns
2. **ENERGY** - Energy levels, fatigue, and mitochondrial function
3. **TRANSPORT** - Cardiovascular and circulation issues
4. **DEFENSE_REPAIR** - Immune function and inflammation
5. **ASSIMILATION** - Digestive system and gut health (moved to 5th position)
6. **BIOTRANSFORMATION** - Detoxification and liver function
7. **COMMUNICATION** - Hormonal and neurological balance
8. **STRUCTURAL** - Musculoskeletal and structural integrity

## Rationale for Order Change

Previously, ASSIMILATION was the 2nd module, which meant users were immediately asked detailed questions about digestive symptoms, timelines, and triggers right after the initial screening. This was problematic because:

1. **Too Early for Detail**: Asking "When did your digestive symptoms first begin?" as one of the first questions assumes the user has digestive issues
2. **Better Flow**: Starting with ENERGY and TRANSPORT provides a more general health assessment before diving into specific system issues
3. **User Experience**: Users without digestive problems felt confused being asked detailed digestive history so early

## Module Characteristics

- **SCREENING**: Always first, establishes baseline
- **ENERGY**: Good second module as fatigue/energy affects everyone
- **TRANSPORT**: Circulation issues are common and less presumptive
- **DEFENSE_REPAIR**: Immune/inflammation assessment
- **ASSIMILATION**: Now includes gateway question "Do you experience any digestive issues?" before detailed questions
- **BIOTRANSFORMATION**: Detox assessment
- **COMMUNICATION**: Hormones and nervous system
- **STRUCTURAL**: Physical/structural issues (appropriately last)

This order provides a more logical flow from general health status to specific system assessments.
