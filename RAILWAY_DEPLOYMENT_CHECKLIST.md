# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Status

### üîß Build Preparation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Fixed 25+ TypeScript errors
- [x] Updated all AI service examples to use singleton pattern
- [x] Fixed async/await issues with Redis cache manager
- [x] Removed Anthropic namespace references
- [x] Successful `npm run build:standalone`
- [x] Pushed all fixes to `feature/railway-deployment` branch

### üß™ Local Testing (COMPLETED)
- [x] AI Framework verification passed
- [x] All 7 test categories successful
- [x] Mock provider working as fallback

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Merge to Main Branch
```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/railway-deployment

# Push to main (triggers Railway deployment)
git push origin main
```

### 2. Environment Variables on Railway
Ensure these are set in Railway dashboard:
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- [ ] `DIRECT_URL` - Direct PostgreSQL URL (for migrations)
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- [ ] `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` - Strong random string for JWT signing
- [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - (Optional) For Claude AI features
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - (Optional) For GPT features
- [ ] `REDIS_URL` - (Optional) For persistent caching
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

#### A. Check Railway Build Logs
- Monitor the build process in Railway dashboard
- Ensure no build errors
- Check deployment status

#### B. Verify Application Health
```bash
# Replace with your Railway app URL
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health
```

#### C. Test AI Service Health
```bash
# Check AI providers status
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/ai/health
```

#### D. Run Remote Verification
```bash
# Set your Railway app URL
export API_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
npm run ai:verify:deployment
```

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### With AI Keys Configured:
- Anthropic/OpenAI providers active
- Full AI analysis capabilities
- Cost tracking enabled

### Without AI Keys (Default):
- Mock provider handles all requests
- Basic functionality maintained
- No external API costs

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
1. Check Railway build logs
2. Verify all environment variables
3. Ensure `NODE_ENV=production`

### Runtime Errors
1. Check application logs in Railway
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Test Supabase connection

### AI Service Issues
1. Verify API keys format
2. Check `/api/ai/health` endpoint
3. Monitor provider status

## üìù Notes

- The application will work without AI API keys using the mock provider
- Redis is optional but recommended for production caching
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- The build includes comprehensive error handling
