- **Features**: Component demos
- **Status**: KEEP AS REFERENCE - useful for component testing

### 8. `/app/test-basic/page.tsx`

## Decision

The production interface at `/app/(dashboard)/assessment/[id]/page.tsx` is already well-built and superior to all test interfaces. We should:

1. Keep the production interface as-is
2. Delete all test interfaces except test-question-rendering (useful for demos)
3. Update navigation to point to the production interface
