# ðŸ”§ Definitive Fix for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Issue

## What We've Done

1. **Created a Production Claude Client** that aggressively tries:
   - Standard `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - With NEXT_PUBLIC prefix
   - Any env var containing 'ANTHROPIC' that has a valid key
   - Dynamic evaluation methods
   
2. **Added Automatic Fallback** in the comprehensive analyzer:
   - Tries standard client first
   - Falls back to production client if needed
   - Logs which method worked

3. **Created Diagnostic Tools**:
   - `/api/test-production-claude` - Most comprehensive test
   - `/api/set-claude-key` - Emergency workaround

## Test After Deployment (2-3 mins)

### Step 1: Test Production Client
```
https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/api/test-production-claude
```

This will show:
- Whether the API key was found (and by which method)
- If the connection to Claude works
- A list of ALL environment variables available
- Specific recommendations based on what it finds

### Step 2: Try Comprehensive Analysis
Go to your client page and click "Run Comprehensive Report"
- It should now work with the fallback system
- Check the browser console for logs showing which client was used

### Step 3: Emergency Workaround (if needed)
If Step 1 shows no API key found, you can temporarily set it:

```bash
curl -X POST https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/api/set-claude-key \
  -H "x-anthropic-api-key: your-actual-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Why This Should Work

1. **Multiple Detection Methods**: We're not relying on just one way to get the key
2. **Production-Specific Logic**: The production client is designed for Vercel's environment
3. **Automatic Fallback**: Even if the standard method fails, the analyzer will try the production client
4. **Clear Diagnostics**: You'll know exactly what's happening

## If It Still Doesn't Work

The `/api/test-production-claude` endpoint will tell us:
- Exactly which environment variables are available
- Whether it's a key detection issue or an API connection issue
- Specific next steps based on what it finds

This approach should definitively solve the issue by trying every possible method to find and use your API key.
