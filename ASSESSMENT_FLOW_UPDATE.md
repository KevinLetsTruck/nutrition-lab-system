# Assessment Flow Update - Natural Question Progression

## Overview
The screening questions have been reorganized to create a more natural, logical flow that integrates seed oil questions contextually rather than clustering them together.

## Previous Issues
- Seed oil questions (8 in total) were grouped together right after the first energy question
- This created an unnatural emphasis on seed oils
- The flow felt disjointed - jumping from energy to intensive diet questions

## New Question Flow

### 1. **General Health Foundation** (Questions 1-3)
- SCR001: Overall energy level
- SCR002: Digestive health (bloating/discomfort) 
- SCR003: Sleep quality

### 2. **Diet-Digestive Connection** (Question 4)
- SCR_SO01: Fried foods frequency *(naturally follows digestive health)*

### 3. **Physical Symptoms** (Questions 5-6)
- SCR004: Joint pain/stiffness
- SCR005: Weight changes

### 4. **Mental Health** (Questions 7-8)
- SCR006: Anxiety/overwhelm
- SCR_SO03: Brain fog after fried foods *(connects diet to mental symptoms)*

### 5. **Lifestyle & Diet Habits** (Questions 9-10)
- SCR_SO02: Cooking oils used at home
- SCR_SO04: Processed foods consumption

### 6. **Diet-Symptom Connections** (Questions 11-12)
- SCR_SO05: Skin issues with fried foods
- SCR_SO06: Low-fat diet history

### 7. **Awareness & Improvement** (Questions 13-14)
- SCR_SO07: Label checking habits
- SCR_SO08: Noticed improvements avoiding oils

## Key Improvements

1. **Natural Progression**: Questions now flow from general health → specific symptoms → dietary connections

2. **Contextual Integration**: Seed oil questions appear when relevant:
   - Fried foods after digestive questions
   - Brain fog after mental health questions
   - Skin reactions paired with physical symptoms

3. **Balanced Distribution**: Seed oil questions are spread throughout rather than clustered

4. **Logical Groupings**: Related topics are kept together while maintaining variety

5. **No Special Emphasis**: Seed oils are treated as one factor among many, not the primary focus

## Impact on Assessment

- More comfortable experience for clients
- Better data quality through natural question flow
- Reduced bias in responses
- Maintains comprehensive coverage while improving flow

## Technical Details

- Total questions in screening: 75 (including additional questions)
- Seed oil questions: 8 (unchanged in number, just redistributed)
- All scoring weights and clinical relevance preserved
- Module triggers and conditions remain intact

The assessment now treats seed oils as one important factor among many health considerations, creating a more holistic and balanced evaluation.
