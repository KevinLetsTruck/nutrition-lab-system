Claude can read all PDFs directly - no processing needed!
```

### **Step 3: Analysis Prompts**

#### **🔍 Comprehensive Analysis Prompt:**

```markdown
I've uploaded a complete functional medicine client export containing:

1. Client summary and structured data
2. 3 NutriQ assessment PDFs with decade of proven clinical data
3. Clinical notes and current treatment protocol

Please analyze this client's functional medicine profile and provide:

1. **Pattern Analysis**: What dysfunction patterns do you see across the NutriQ assessments?
2. **System Priorities**: Which body systems need immediate attention?
3. **Protocol Review**: How well does the current protocol address identified issues?
4. **Optimization Recommendations**: What adjustments would optimize outcomes?
5. **Testing Priorities**: What additional functional testing would be most valuable?

Focus on the NutriQ data as the primary assessment - it represents 10+ years of clinical validation.
```

#### **🎯 Specific Focus Prompts:**

```markdown
# Digestive Focus

"Analyze the digestive health indicators across all assessments. What specific interventions should be prioritized?"

# Energy/Adrenal Analysis

"Review the energy and adrenal markers. Is chronic fatigue addressed adequately in the current protocol?"

# Root Cause Analysis

"Looking at all assessment data, what are the likely root causes of this client's health concerns?"

# Protocol Optimization

"Compare the NutriQ findings with the current treatment protocol. What's missing or needs adjustment?"
```
