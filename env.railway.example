# Node environment - set to 'production' for Railway
# Railway automatically sets this, but it's good to be explicit
NODE_ENV=production

# Port configuration - Railway will override this with its own PORT
# Railway dynamically assigns ports, so this is just a fallback
PORT=3000

# Additional optional environment variables you might need:

# Email configuration (if using Resend or similar)
# RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# AWS configuration (if using S3 for file storage)
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name

# Application URLs (Railway will provide these)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
# NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# Security keys (generate your own)
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
# JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-here

# Notes for Railway deployment:
# 1. Add these variables in Railway's dashboard under "Variables"
# 2. Railway automatically injects PORT and some other variables
# 3. Use Railway's secret management for sensitive values
# 4. Some variables like NEXT_PUBLIC_* are built into the app at build time
# 5. Non-NEXT_PUBLIC variables are only available server-side
