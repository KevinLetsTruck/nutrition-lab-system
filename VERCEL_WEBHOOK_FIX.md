# Fix Vercel GitHub Integration

The GitHub → Vercel webhook is not triggering deployments for new commits.

## How to Fix:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Click on your project
   - Go to Settings → Git
   
2. **Check GitHub Integration**
   - Verify it shows "Connected to GitHub"
   - Check if "Auto-deploy" is enabled for main branch
   
3. **If Broken, Reconnect:**
   - Click "Disconnect from GitHub"
   - Click "Connect to GitHub" 
   - Authorize and select repository
   - Enable auto-deploy for main branch

4. **Alternative: Manual Webhook**
   - In GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks
   - Check if Vercel webhook exists and is active
   - Look for failed deliveries

## Current Status:
- Latest commit ready: `efd048e` (has all fixes)
- Manual deployment coming in ~30 seconds
- All build errors have been fixed
