To restore to this stable point:

git reset --hard rollback-notes-docs-fixed-v3.1.0
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Thursday Calls page showing "No notes available" and "No documents"
- 500 Internal Server Error from Notes and Documents APIs
- Prisma validation errors: "Unknown field 'client' for include statement"

### Root Cause
- Prisma schema uses capitalized relationship names (`Client`)
- APIs were using lowercase `client` in include statements
- Client detail pages worked because they use different endpoint

### Solution
- Updated all Prisma include statements in:
  - `/api/documents/route.ts` 
  - `/api/clients/[clientId]/notes/route.ts` (GET and POST methods)
- Changed `client` → `Client` in all relationship includes

## 📋 Verified Working Features

### Thursday Calls Page

### Export/Import System
