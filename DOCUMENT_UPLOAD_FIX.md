# Document Upload Fix - What Was Happening

## The Problem
When you uploaded documents for "Kevin Test" (kevin2@letstruck.com), they were uploaded successfully BUT weren't showing up in the client detail page.

## Why This Happened
Your system has two different client identification systems:
1. **client_profiles table** - Part of the new authentication system
2. **clients table** - The original client management system

The specific issue:
- The client detail page uses the `client_profiles` ID: `6f91bfe4-a4ca-4f9f-8022-5c643676ae65`
- But documents are uploaded linked to the `clients` table ID: `336ac9e9-dda3-477f-89d5-241df47b8745`
- These are the SAME person (kevin2@letstruck.com) but with different IDs in different tables

## What I Found
Using the diagnostic script, I discovered:
- ✅ 2 documents WERE successfully uploaded for kevin2@letstruck.com
- ❌ But they were linked to the `clients` table ID
- ❌ The client page was only looking for documents with the `client_profiles` ID

## The Fix
I updated the client dashboard to:
1. First look for documents using the profile ID
2. If none found, look up the client by email and check with the clients table ID
3. This ensures documents are found regardless of which ID system was used

## Result
Now when you refresh the client detail page, you should see:
- 2 NutriQ documents that were uploaded earlier
- Any future uploads will also appear correctly

## Testing the Fix
1. Go back to the Kevin Test client page
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Click on the "Documents" tab
4. You should now see the 2 uploaded documents

## Long-term Solution
Eventually, the system should be updated to use a single consistent client identification system, but this fix ensures everything works smoothly in the meantime.
