# FNTP Assessment System - CURRENT STATUS (Post-Cleanup)

## ✅ WHAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW (Jan 2025)

### Working 80-Question Assessment System
- **Questions**: 80 total (8 categories × 10 questions each)
- **Location**: `src/lib/simple-assessment/questions.ts`
- **Categories**: digestive, energy, immune, hormonal, detox, cardiovascular
- **Database**: `SimpleAssessment` and `SimpleResponse` models

### Working Components
- **Frontend**: `src/app/simple-assessment/page.tsx`
- **Form Component**: `src/components/simple-assessment/SimpleAssessmentForm.tsx`
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/simple-assessment/start` - Start assessment
  - `POST /api/simple-assessment/[id]/submit` - Submit answers  
  - `GET /api/simple-assessment/[id]/status` - Get progress
  - `GET /api/simple-assessment/test` - Health check

### What Works
- ✅ Assessment starts and saves progress
- ✅ All 80 questions display properly
- ✅ Responses save to database
- ✅ Progress tracking functional
- ✅ Error handling and validation

## 🎯 PRODUCTION TRACK GAPS

1. **Public Access**: Currently hardcoded client ID
2. **Completion Flow**: No results page after finishing
3. **Basic Analysis**: No health scoring or insights
4. **Admin Dashboard**: No way to view completed assessments

## 🚨 WHAT WAS ELIMINATED

- ❌ 406-question complex system - COMPLETELY REMOVED
- ❌ AssessmentTemplate database model - NO LONGER EXISTS  
- ❌ AI adaptive questioning - SIMPLIFIED
- ❌ Complex assessment logic - REMOVED

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Production Track)

1. Make assessment publicly accessible (remove hardcoded client)
2. Create completion flow with basic results
3. Add simple health scoring (no complex AI)
4. Build admin view for practitioners

## 📏 DUAL-TRACK STRATEGY

- **Production Track**: Complete current 80-question system for practice use
- **Research Track**: Advanced AI features in separate project

**Current Focus**: Production track - get working system deployed in 2 weeks.
