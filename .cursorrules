# Nutrition Lab System - Project Rules

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow Rules
1. **Always push changes when finished** - After completing any feature, fix, or update, commit and push changes to the repository
2. **Use descriptive commit messages** - Clearly describe what was changed and why
3. **Commit related changes together** - Group related modifications in single commits
4. **Push after testing** - Ensure changes work before pushing

### Automatic Push Rule
When completing any task:
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: [description of change]"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

### Commit Message Format
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Code Quality Rules
1. **Test before pushing** - Run relevant test scripts
2. **Check for linter errors** - Fix any issues before committing
3. **Update documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes
4. **Clean up temporary files** - Remove test/debug files

### Project-Specific Rules
1. **Sensitive data** - Never commit API keys or credentials
2. **PDF handling** - Test with both text and image-based PDFs
3. **Error messages** - Provide user-friendly error messages
4. **Logging** - Include detailed logging for debugging
