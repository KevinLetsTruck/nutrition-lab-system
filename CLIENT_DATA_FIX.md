# Client Data Display Fix

## Issue Identified
The clients page was not displaying data due to a missing database column: `archived_at`

## Root Cause
- The code was trying to filter clients by `archived_at IS NULL`
- The `archived_at` column doesn't exist in the database
- This caused Supabase queries to fail with error: "column clients.archived_at does not exist"

## Fix Applied
1. **Commented out archived filtering** in the data fetch logic
2. **Removed archive-related UI elements**:
   - Hide "Show Archived" button
   - Hide archived clients stats card
   - Remove archived badge from client list
3. **Updated grid layout** from 4 columns to 3 columns for stats cards

## Files Modified
- `src/app/clients/page.tsx` - Fixed all references to archived_at column

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Database connection verified (17 clients exist)
- ✅ Client-side Supabase access works (no RLS issues)
- ✅ Removed problematic archived_at filtering
- ✅ Added debug logging to trace data flow

## Next Steps
1. **Restart the development server** to apply changes
2. **Navigate to http://localhost:3000/clients**
3. **Check browser console** for debug logs showing client data

## Optional: Add Archived Support
If you want to support client archiving in the future:

```sql
-- Add archived_at column to clients table
ALTER TABLE clients 
ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_clients_archived_at ON clients(archived_at);
```

Then uncomment the archived-related code in the clients page.

## Debug Info Added
The page now shows a debug panel in development mode displaying:
- Total clients in state
- Filtered clients count
- Search query status
- Authentication status

This can be removed once everything is working properly.
