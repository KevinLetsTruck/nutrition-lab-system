# Critical Assessment Logic Issues

## 1. Abdominal Pain Questions - No Conditional Logic

### Current Problem:
The assessment asks 4+ sequential questions about abdominal pain even after users indicate they have NO pain:
- ASM026: "Where do you typically experience abdominal pain?" → User selects "No pain"
- ASM027: "How would you describe your abdominal pain?" → User must select "No pain" again
- ASM028: "Does eating relieve or worsen your abdominal pain?" → User selects "I don't have pain" again
- ASM029: "Do you have pain 2-3 hours after eating?" → No "no pain" option!

### User Impact:
- Extremely frustrating to repeatedly indicate "no pain"
- Makes the assessment feel broken or poorly designed
- Wastes user time on irrelevant questions

### Ideal Solution:
Implement conditional question logic:
```
IF answer to ASM026 = "no_pain" THEN
  SKIP questions ASM027, ASM028, ASM029, ASM030
END IF
```

### Temporary Solutions:
1. **Consolidate into one comprehensive question** with sub-questions that appear only if pain is indicated
2. **Remove redundant questions** - keep only the most clinically relevant
3. **Add "I don't have pain" option** to ALL pain-related questions

## 2. Similar Issues Found:
- Digestive symptoms questions continue even after "no digestive issues" indicated
- Food sensitivity questions don't skip when "no sensitivities" selected
- Bowel movement questions continue regardless of normal function indicated

## 3. Missing Conditional Logic Throughout:
The assessment lacks ANY conditional branching, leading to:
- Redundant questions
- Illogical question flow
- Poor user experience
- Longer assessment time than necessary

## Recommendation:
The assessment engine needs to be updated to support conditional question logic before this can provide a good user experience. Without it, users will continue to be frustrated by having to answer irrelevant questions.
