# ðŸ”„ Server Restart Required

I've cleared the Next.js cache. You need to restart your development server again:

1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal running `npm run dev`)
2. **Start it again**: `npm run dev`

The `.next` cache directory has been removed, which will force Next.js to rebuild with the correct Prisma client.

## After restarting:

Test the API again:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/simple-assessment/test
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Database connection working",
    "counts": {
      "clients": 1,
      "assessments": 0,
      "responses": 0
    }
  }
}
```

Then run the full test:

```bash
node scripts/test-simple-api.js
```
