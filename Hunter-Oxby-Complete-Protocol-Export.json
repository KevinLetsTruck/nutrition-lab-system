Phase 2 adds Bio-6-Plus (digestive enzymes), ChromeMate GTF (glucose metabolism), and Bio-Adrenal (comprehensive adrenal support) for complete recovery protocol. All supplements chosen based on specific lab abnormalities and symptom patterns with evidence-based dosing.",
    "riskFactors": "High-stress trucking occupation, severe adrenal dysfunction, metabolic syndrome risk factors, elevated blood pressure, rapid cortisol clearance indicating insulin resistance, food sensitivities contributing to inflammatory burden, chronic stress pattern with poor stress recovery.",
    "expectedOutcomes": "Week 1: Improved morning energy and alertness from LyteBalance. Week 2: Reduced post-meal fatigue and sugar cravings from Calocurb. Week 4: Blood pressure trending toward normal range, improved stress tolerance, better sleep quality, foundation established for Phase 2 targeted interventions.",
    "followUpTesting": "30-day follow-up assessment to evaluate symptom improvements and supplement compliance. Consider 60-day blood pressure monitoring. 90-day Dutch Test repeat to assess cortisol pattern normalization and adrenal recovery. Annual cardiovascular risk assessment given trucking occupation and current BP elevation."
