# Client Assessment URL Information

## Client Assessment Flow

When a client wants to start their health assessment, they follow this flow:

### 1. **Starting Point - Homepage**
- **URL**: `https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/`
- Client clicks "Begin Your Health Journey" button

### 2. **Automatic Redirect**
- **URL**: `https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/start-assessment`
- This page automatically:
  - Checks if the user is logged in
  - If not logged in → Redirects to login page
  - If logged in as client → Finds their client ID and redirects to assessment
  - If logged in as admin → Redirects to clients management page

### 3. **Final Assessment URL (for logged-in clients)**
- **URL Pattern**: `https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/assessments/structured/{clientId}`
- **Example**: `https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/assessments/structured/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`

## Direct Access

If a client is already logged in and knows their client ID, they can directly access:
- `https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/assessments/structured/{their-client-id}`

## Admin Flow

Admins now skip the homepage entirely:
- When an admin visits the homepage, they are automatically redirected to `/clients`
- The "Assessments" menu item has been removed from navigation
- Admins manage clients directly without seeing the marketing homepage

2. ✅ Removed "Assessments" from all navigation menus
3. ✅ Updated dashboard "Start Assessment" button to use `/start-assessment`
4. ✅ Client flow remains: Homepage → Start Assessment → Structured Assessment
