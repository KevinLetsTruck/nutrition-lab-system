# Immediate Solution for Scanned PDF Support

## Quick Implementation (Today)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Use the Enhanced Upload Component
Replace the current upload component with the enhanced version:

```typescript
// In your upload page
import { FileUploadSectionEnhanced } from '@/components/ui/file-upload-section-enhanced'

export default function UploadPage() {
  return (
    <FileUploadSectionEnhanced 
      onAnalysisComplete={(results) => {
        console.log('Analysis results:', results)
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### 3. How It Works

1. **Client-Side Conversion**:
   - User uploads PDF
   - PDF.js converts each page to an image in the browser
   - No server dependencies needed

2. **Server-Side Analysis**:
   - Images sent to `/api/analyze-images`
   - Claude Vision extracts text from images
   - Standard analysis pipeline processes the text

### 4. Current Status

✅ **What Works Now**:
- Client-side PDF to image conversion
- Claude Vision text extraction
- Analysis of scanned documents
- Multi-page support (up to 10 pages)

⚠️ **Limitations**:
- Max 10 pages per document (can be increased)
- Higher API costs than text extraction
- Slower processing (2-3 seconds per page)

### 5. Deploy the Changes

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add support for scanned PDFs using client-side conversion"
git push origin main
```

## Next Steps (This Week)

### Option 1: AWS Textract Integration
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-textract
```

Then update the analyze-images route to use Textract instead of Claude Vision for better accuracy and lower costs.

### Option 2: Google Document AI
```bash
npm install @google-cloud/documentai
```

Similar integration but with Google's service.

## Testing

1. **Test with a scanned PDF**:
   - Open any PDF in a viewer
   - If you can't select text, it's scanned
   - Upload it through the new component
   - Should process successfully

2. **Monitor Costs**:
   - Claude Vision: ~$3 per 1000 pages
   - AWS Textract: ~$1.50 per 1000 pages
   - Google Document AI: ~$1.50 per 1000 pages

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Update upload UI to use enhanced component
- [ ] Test with various scanned PDFs
- [ ] Monitor Claude API usage
- [ ] Set up cost alerts
- [ ] Plan migration to AWS/Google service

This solution works immediately and handles any type of PDF document!
