# Assessment Redesign Plan

## Current Problems
1. **374 total questions** - Far too many, causing assessment fatigue
2. **Massive redundancy** - Same questions repeated across modules
3. **Poor organization** - Not organized by body systems
4. **Uneven distribution** - Communication: 75 questions, Transport: 26 questions
5. **Missing modern health topics** - No COVID-19, vaccine, or seed oil questions
6. **Underrepresented systems** - Only 6 respiratory, 7 skin questions

## New Structure: Body System-Based Assessment

### Target: 150-200 Total Questions (Max)

## Body Systems with Symptom Focus

### 1. NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEM (15-20 questions)
- Headaches/migraines
- Brain fog/memory
- Focus/concentration
- Mood/anxiety/depression
- Sleep quality
- Stress response
- Post-COVID neurological symptoms
- Vaccine-related neurological concerns

### 2. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM (15-20 questions)
- Bloating/gas
- Bowel movements
- Food sensitivities
- Stomach pain
- Acid reflux
- Appetite changes
- Seed oil intolerance symptoms
- Post-meal fatigue

### 3. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM (10-15 questions)
- Heart palpitations
- Blood pressure issues
- Chest discomfort
- Circulation problems
- Post-COVID cardiac symptoms
- Vaccine-related cardiac concerns
- Driver-specific cardiovascular risks

### 4. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM (10-15 questions)
- Breathing difficulties
- Chronic cough
- Sinus issues
- Post-COVID respiratory symptoms
- Exercise tolerance
- Sleep apnea (driver-specific)

### 5. IMMUNE SYSTEM (10-15 questions)
- Frequency of infections
- Recovery time
- Allergies
- Autoimmune symptoms
- Post-COVID immune dysfunction
- Vaccine reactions

### 6. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM (10-15 questions)
- Joint pain/stiffness
- Muscle weakness
- Back pain (driver-specific)
- Recovery from exercise
- Inflammation markers

### 7. ENDOCRINE SYSTEM (10-15 questions)
- Energy levels
- Weight management
- Temperature regulation
- Hormonal symptoms
- Blood sugar regulation
- Thyroid symptoms

### 8. SKIN/INTEGUMENTARY (8-10 questions)
- Skin conditions
- Wound healing
- Hair/nail health
- Rashes/reactions
- Seed oil-related skin issues

### 9. GENITOURINARY SYSTEM (8-10 questions)
- Urinary frequency
- UTI tendency
- Reproductive health
- Libido changes

### 10. SPECIAL TOPICS (15-20 questions)
- Seed oil consumption/reactions
- COVID-19 history and symptoms
- Vaccine status and reactions
- Commercial driver specific issues
- Environmental exposures
- Medication/supplement use

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Remove Redundancies
- Eliminate duplicate questions
- Merge similar questions
- Keep best version of each concept

### Phase 2: Reorganize by Body System
- Move questions to appropriate system
- Ensure comprehensive symptom coverage
- Add missing symptom questions

### Phase 3: Add Modern Health Questions
- Seed oil damage indicators
- Long COVID symptoms
- Vaccine adverse events
- Driver health specifics

### Phase 4: Implement Smart Logic
- Skip irrelevant systems based on initial screening
- Use AI to determine which systems need deeper exploration
- Progressive questioning (start broad, go specific)

### Phase 5: Scoring System
- 0-3 scale like NutriQ
- Weighted by clinical significance
- System-specific risk scores
- Overall health score

## Key Improvements Over NutriQ
1. AI-driven adaptive questioning
2. Modern health concerns (COVID, seed oils)
3. Better skip logic
4. More comprehensive symptom coverage
5. Driver-specific health assessment
6. Integrated with our existing infrastructure
