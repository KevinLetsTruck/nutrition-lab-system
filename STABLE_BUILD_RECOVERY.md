## Tips for Safe Feature Development

1. **Use feature branches**: Never develop major features directly on main
2. **Commit often**: Small, frequent commits are easier to revert
3. **Tag milestones**: Create tags for each successful feature addition
4. **Document changes**: Keep notes on what you're changing

Good luck with your new features! You can always come back to this stable build. üöÄ
