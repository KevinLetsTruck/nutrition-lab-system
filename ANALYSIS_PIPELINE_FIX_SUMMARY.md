# Analysis Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Claude API Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging for API requests and responses
- Added specific error messages for different HTTP status codes (400, 401, 429, 500+)
- Added network error detection (ECONNREFUSED, timeout, fetch failed)
- Added API key validation logging
- Added `anthropic-version` header to API requests
- Added temperature parameter (set to 0 for consistent results)

### 2. Improved PDF Parser
- Added file header detection to identify PDF vs text files
- Enhanced error messages for corrupted, encrypted, or password-protected PDFs
- Added detection for image-based (scanned) PDFs
- Added comprehensive logging of PDF metadata
- Better handling of empty or insufficient text extraction

### 3. Enhanced Master Analyzer
- Added step-by-step logging throughout the analysis pipeline
- Added specific error handling for each analyzer type
- Added timing information for performance monitoring
- Better error propagation with specific error messages
- Added confidence score logging

### 4. Test Script Created
- Created `scripts/test-claude-api.js` to verify API connection
- Tests basic API connectivity
- Tests lab report type detection
- Provides detailed error diagnostics

## How to Debug Issues

### 1. First, test the Claude API connection:
```bash
node scripts/test-claude-api.js
```

This will verify:
- API key is present and valid format
- Can connect to Claude API
- Can perform basic analysis

### 2. Check the console logs when running analysis:
Look for these key log sections:
- `[CLAUDE]` - Claude API interactions
- `[PDF-PARSER]` - PDF extraction issues
- `[MASTER-ANALYZER]` - Overall pipeline flow
- `[ANALYZE]` - API endpoint processing

### 3. Common Issues and Solutions:

#### API Key Issues:
- **401 Error**: Invalid API key - check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- **Format**: Key should start with `sk-ant-`
- **Length**: Key should be ~100+ characters

#### PDF Issues:
- **Empty PDF**: Check if PDF contains text (not scanned/image-based)
- **Corrupted**: Try re-downloading or re-creating the PDF
- **Protected**: Remove password protection before uploading

#### Network Issues:
- **Timeout**: Large files may take longer - retry mechanism will handle this
- **Connection refused**: Check internet connectivity
- **Rate limit**: Wait a few moments and try again

### 4. Expected Log Flow for Successful Analysis:

```
[ANALYZE] ========== Starting new analysis request ==========
[ANALYZE] File retrieved successfully
[MASTER-ANALYZER] ===== Starting analysis pipeline =====
[PDF-PARSER] ===== Starting PDF parsing =====
[PDF-PARSER] PDF parsed successfully
[CLAUDE] ===== Starting Claude API call =====
[CLAUDE] API call successful!
[MASTER-ANALYZER] Report type detected: nutriq
[CLAUDE] ===== Starting Claude API call =====
[CLAUDE] API call successful!
[MASTER-ANALYZER] ===== Analysis pipeline complete =====
[ANALYZE] Analysis saved to database successfully
[ANALYZE] ========== Analysis complete ==========
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script** to verify Claude API is working:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-claude-api.js
   ```

2. **Upload a test file** through the UI and monitor the console logs

3. **Check the database** to see if reports are moving from:
   - `pending` → `processing` → `completed`

4. **If still having issues**, check:
   - Vercel deployment logs (if deployed)
   - Browser console for frontend errors
   - Network tab for API response details

## Error Response Format

The API now returns detailed error information:
```json
{
  "error": "Analysis failed",
  "errorType": "CLAUDE_API_ERROR|PARSING_ERROR|PDF_ERROR",
  "details": "Specific error message",
  "reportId": "xxx",
  "suggestion": "Helpful suggestion for user"
}
```

This helps identify exactly where the pipeline is failing and provides actionable feedback to users.
