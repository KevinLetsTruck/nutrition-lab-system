# FNTP Assessment System - Complete Status Audit
**Generated**: August 22, 2025
**Purpose**: Establish single source of truth and prevent duplicate work

## üîç AUDIT RESULTS

### Database Assessment Templates
Found **3 assessment templates** in the database:

1. **Template ID: default** (Created: Aug 23, 2025)
   - Version: 1.0
   - Questions: 2 (stored as object - likely incomplete/test data)
   - Status: Active

2. **Template ID: cmehiw7v20003v2a17ge8c3j7** (Created: Aug 19, 2025)
   - Version: 1.0.1
   - Questions: 14 (stored as array)
   - Status: Active

3. **Template ID: cmehiw7v20002v2a1ks6sc4pi** (Created: Aug 19, 2025)
   - Version: 1.0.1
   - Questions: 14 (stored as array)
   - Status: Active

**‚ö†Ô∏è DATABASE STATUS**: Only 14 questions max in database - FAR from complete 400+

### File System Question Files

#### Active TypeScript Files (/lib/assessment/questions/)
- `screening-questions.ts` + `screening-questions-additional.ts`
- `assimilation-questions.ts` (split into 4 chunks)
- `defense-repair-questions.ts`
- `energy-questions.ts`
- `biotransformation-questions.ts`
- `transport-questions.ts`
- `communication-questions.ts` + `communication-questions-additional.ts`
- `structural-questions.ts`
- `index.ts` (exports all modules)

#### Recovered JSON Files (/lib/assessment/questions/recovered/)
- `all-questions.json`
- Individual module JSON files for each node
- `seed-oil-questions.json`

**üìä Need to count actual questions in these files**

### Git History Analysis
- **Aug 16**: Checkpoint commit mentions "Working assessment with 15 questions" - matches database
- **Aug 15**: Multiple commits for UI/theme work
- **Aug 22**: Recent refactoring removing pages

**No evidence of 400+ questions being successfully loaded into database**

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. IMMEDIATE ACTION: Count Questions in Files
We need to determine which file source has the complete 400+ questions:
- TypeScript files in `/lib/assessment/questions/`
- JSON files in `/lib/assessment/questions/recovered/`

### 2. Choose Single Source of Truth
Based on the audit, the **file system** likely contains the complete questions, NOT the database.
The database only has test data (14-15 questions).

### 3. Migration Strategy
1. Count questions in both TS and JSON files
2. Choose the most complete set
3. Create a proper seed script
4. Load ALL questions into database
5. Create checkpoint system

## ‚ùå WHAT'S NOT WORKING
- Database has almost no questions (14 max)
- Multiple duplicate templates with same version numbers
- No clear primary source of truth
- Questions exist in files but not loaded to database

## ‚úÖ WHAT IS WORKING
- Database connection is solid
- Schema is properly set up
- File structure is organized
- Basic test interfaces exist

## üìã NEXT STEPS
1. Count questions in TypeScript files
2. Count questions in JSON recovered files
3. Choose the most complete set
4. Create proper seed script
5. Load into database ONCE
6. Delete duplicate/incomplete templates
7. Create checkpoint system

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING
**The 400+ questions exist in FILES but were NEVER properly loaded into the database.**
This is why every new session thinks questions are missing - they're checking the database which only has test data!
