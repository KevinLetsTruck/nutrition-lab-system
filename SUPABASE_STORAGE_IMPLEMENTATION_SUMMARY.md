- **Database integration** for lab report tracking

### 5. **Onboarding Uploads API** (`src/app/api/onboarding/uploads/route.ts`)
- **Session-based file uploads** for onboarding process
- **Categorized file storage** for different document types
- **Client file metadata tracking** in database
- **Secure access control** with session validation

### 6. **Storage Management Scripts**
- **`scripts/init-storage.js`** - Initialize all storage buckets
- **`scripts/test-storage.js`** - Comprehensive storage testing
- **`npm run storage:init`** - Easy bucket setup
- **`npm run storage:test`** - Verify storage integration

### 7. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`docs/SUPABASE_STORAGE.md`)
- **Complete setup instructions** for production deployment
- **API integration examples** for all file operations
- **Security considerations** and best practices
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Production

### 1. **Deploy to Vercel**
Your system is now ready for production deployment on Vercel. The storage integration ensures all file operations work correctly in the serverless environment.

### 2. **Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in your Vercel project:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. **Test the Complete Flow**
1. **Upload files** through the web interface
2. **Verify storage** in Supabase dashboard
3. **Test analysis** with uploaded files
4. **Check database records** are created correctly

### 4. **Monitor Performance**
