# Assessment Progress Indicator Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Question Type Label

- **Before**: Each question displayed a badge showing "YES NO", "LIKERT SCALE", etc.
- **After**: Question type label removed for cleaner interface
- **Reason**: The question format is self-evident from the input controls

### 2. Fixed Misleading Progress Indicators

#### Question Counter

- **Before**: "Question 2 of 374"
- **After**: "Question 2"
- **Reason**: Users won't answer all 374 questions due to AI-powered adaptive questioning

#### Percentage Complete

- **Before**: "X% Complete" based on total questions
- **After**: Removed entirely
- **Reason**: Percentage was misleading since total questions answered varies by user

#### Progress Bar

- **Before**: Traditional progress bar showing percentage of 374 questions
- **After**: Subtle visual progress indicator that grows gradually
- **Implementation**:
  - Grows by 2% per question answered
  - Caps at 95% to never imply completion
  - Uses gradient from green to orange
  - No numbers or percentages shown

### 3. Added Context Information

- Shows current module name (e.g., "Current Module: SCREENING")
- Helps users understand which area of health is being assessed

## Result

The interface is now:

- More honest about the adaptive nature of the assessment
- Less intimidating (no "374 questions" to scare users)
- Cleaner and more focused on the current question
- Still provides visual feedback on progress without being misleading
