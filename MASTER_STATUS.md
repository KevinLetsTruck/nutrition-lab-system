## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Check System Health
```bash
node checkpoint.js
```

### View the ONE Template
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Look for template ID: "default"
# It's the ONLY one there
```

### Start Building
The questions are DONE. Focus on:
1. Assessment UI components
2. API endpoints
3. Response saving
4. AI integration
5. NOT touching the questions (they're perfect)

## ⚠️ NEVER AGAIN Rules

1. **NEVER create new question files** - Use `/lib/assessment/questions/`
2. **NEVER create new templates** - Use ID `default`
3. **NEVER assume questions are missing** - Run `checkpoint.js` first
4. **ALWAYS check this file** before starting work
5. **ALWAYS use the database template** ID `default`

## 📁 The ONLY Locations That Matter

- **Questions Source**: `/lib/assessment/questions/index.ts`

- **Status**: This file (MASTER_STATUS.md)
- **Health Check**: `checkpoint.js`
