# SYSTEM REALITY - What Actually Exists (Not Plans)

**Last Updated**: August 22, 2025
**Verified By**: checkpoint.js

## ✅ Database Reality
- **Template ID**: `default`
- **Template Name**: "MAIN ASSESSMENT - 406 Questions - USE THIS ONE"
- **Version**: 2.0.0-FINAL
- **Questions**: 406 (COMPLETE and VERIFIED)
- **Created**: August 23, 2025
- **Status**: ✅ Working

## ✅ UI Interfaces (All Built and Exist)
- `/test-simple` - Main test interface with all question types ✅
- `/test-assessment` - Alternative interface with login ✅
- `/test-assessment-flow` - Flow testing interface ✅
- `/test-question-rendering` - Question rendering test ✅
- `/test-medical` - Medical document testing ✅
- `/test-auth` - Auth testing ✅
- `/test` - General test page ✅

## ✅ Question Components (All Built)
Located in `/src/components/assessment/questions/`:
- `LikertScale.tsx` - 5-point scale ✅
- `YesNo.tsx` - Binary choice ✅
- `MultipleChoice.tsx` - Single selection ✅
- `MultiSelect.tsx` - Multiple selections ✅
- `Frequency.tsx` - Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Always ✅
- `Duration.tsx` - Time-based responses ✅
- `TextInput.tsx` - Free text ✅
- `NumberInput.tsx` - Numeric input ✅
- **ALL HAVE DEMO COMPONENTS** for testing

## ✅ Assessment Components (Built)
Located in `/src/components/assessment/`:
- `AssessmentFlow.tsx` - Main flow controller ✅
- `AssessmentProgress.tsx` - Progress tracking ✅
- `AssessmentProvider.tsx` - State management ✅
- `QuestionRenderer.tsx` - Question display logic ✅

## ✅ Question Files (Complete)
Located in `/src/lib/assessment/questions/`:
- 15 TypeScript files containing all 406 questions
- `index.ts` exports all modules
- Organized by functional medicine nodes

## ✅ API Structure
Located in `/src/app/api/`:
- `/assessment/` - Assessment endpoints
- `/auth/` - Authentication endpoints
- `/clients/` - Client management
- `/medical-documents/` - Document processing

## ✅ What's Been Fixed Multiple Times
- Dark mode (FIXED - works across dashboard)
- Question scaling (FIXED - uses 5-point scale)
- Authentication (FIXED - TEST_MODE available)
- Database schema (COMPLETE)

## ❌ Known Current Issues
1. **Response Saving**: POST to `/api/assessment/response` may return 500
2. **Assessment Completion**: Flow doesn't properly complete
3. **Protocol Generation**: Not connected yet
4. **Client Portal View**: Not implemented

## 🛑 DO NOT REBUILD (These Exist and Work)
1. **Questions** - 406 in database, complete
2. **Basic UI** - Multiple versions exist, use `/test-simple`
3. **Question Components** - All 8 types built with demos
4. **Dark Mode** - Fixed and working
5. **API Structure** - Exists, may need connection fixes
6. **Database Schema** - Complete and working

## 🎯 What Actually Needs Work
1. Fix response saving (500 error)
2. Connect assessment completion flow
3. Implement protocol generation
4. Build client result viewing

## 📋 Quick Verification Commands
```bash
# Check system health
node checkpoint.js

# View database
npx prisma studio

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test interfaces
# http://localhost:3000/test-simple (main)
# http://localhost:3000/test-assessment (with auth)
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **"Questions are missing"** - NO, they're in template ID `default`
2. **"UI doesn't exist"** - NO, check `/test-simple` and others
3. **"Need to create components"** - NO, check `/src/components/assessment/questions/`
4. **"Dark mode broken"** - NO, it's been fixed
5. **"Need new template"** - NO, use ID `default`

## 📝 How to Continue Development
1. Run `checkpoint.js` first
2. Test existing interfaces before building new ones
3. Check `/src/components/assessment/` for existing components
4. Focus on connecting what exists, not rebuilding
5. Fix the response saving issue first
