## üîç Verification Checklist

After adding all keys and restarting Claude:

### Linear Server
- [ ] Can list issues
- [ ] Can create new issues
- [ ] Can update issue status
- [ ] Can add comments

### Sentry Server
- [ ] Can list recent errors
- [ ] Can analyze error patterns
- [ ] Can mark issues as resolved
- [ ] Can check deployment health

### Railway Server
- [ ] Can deploy to production
- [ ] Can check deployment status
- [ ] Can view logs
- [ ] Can manage environment variables

## üöÄ What Claude Can Do With These Keys

### Automated Workflow Example:
1. **Claude detects error** in Sentry
2. **Analyzes the pattern** and finds the bug
3. **Creates Linear issue** with details
4. **Fixes the code** using filesystem access
5. **Tests the fix** with terminal server
6. **Commits changes** (when git is fixed)
7. **Deploys to Railway**
8. **Monitors Sentry** for resolution
9. **Updates Linear issue** to Done

### Daily Automation:
- Morning: Check overnight Sentry errors
- Create Linear tasks for critical issues
- Fix bugs throughout the day
- Deploy fixes to production
- Update task statuses
- End of day: Report on resolved issues

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit .env file** to git
- **Rotate tokens** every 90 days
- **Use read-only tokens** where possible
- **Limit scopes** to minimum required

## üìä Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when Claude can say:
- "I see 3 critical errors in Sentry from last night"
- "I've created Linear issue ENG-123 for this bug"
- "The fix is deployed to production"
- "Error rate has dropped to zero after the deployment"

## üéâ You're Done!

With all these keys configured, Claude becomes your:
- **DevOps Engineer** (deployments)
- **QA Engineer** (error monitoring)
- **Project Manager** (task tracking)
- **Full-Stack Developer** (code fixes)

All in one AI assistant! üöÄ
