# ✅ Body System Questions Successfully Integrated!

## What Changed

### Before (Old System)
- 440+ questions across functional modules (SCREENING, ENERGY, etc.)
- Highly redundant - multiple variations of same questions
- No logical flow based on symptoms
- Poor user experience with 78+ questions of similar content

### After (New System)
- 246 focused questions across 10 body systems
- No redundancy - each question has unique diagnostic value
- Logical progression through body systems
- AI prioritizes based on symptoms

## New Module Flow

1. **NEUROLOGICAL** (20 questions) - Brain, mood, memory, sleep
2. **DIGESTIVE** (20 questions) - Gut health, digestion
3. **CARDIOVASCULAR** (28 questions) - Heart, circulation
