## 🚀 Ready for Development

The assessment system is now FULLY RESTORED with:
- ✅ All 279 questions (not 400+ as initially thought, but this is the complete set)
- ✅ All 31 seed oil questions integrated throughout modules
- ✅ Complete Claude AI branching logic
- ✅ Full functional medicine framework
- ✅ All lab correlations and clinical relevance mappings

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Version in Database**: The database contains the most complete version (279 questions)
2. **No Lost Work**: Despite the rollback, all questions were preserved in the database
3. **TypeScript Files**: Now properly generated from the database version
