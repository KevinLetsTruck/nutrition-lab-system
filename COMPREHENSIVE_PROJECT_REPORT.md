# üìä Nutrition Lab System - Comprehensive Project Report

## üéØ Project Overview

The **Nutrition Lab System** is a sophisticated health management platform designed for Functional Nutritional Therapy Practitioners (FNTPs) to manage clients, analyze lab results, and generate comprehensive health protocols. The system leverages AI-powered analysis to provide deep insights from various health assessments and lab reports.

### Key Value Propositions:
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Claude AI to analyze lab results and generate personalized health protocols
- **Document Management**: Handles multiple types of medical documents (PDFs, images)
- **Comprehensive Client Management**: Tracks client progress, assessments, and protocols
- **Visual Analytics**: Displays health data through charts and progress tracking

## üîß Last Five Major Fixes

### 1. **Aggressive API Key Detection System** (Commit: `50cb9c5`)
**Problem**: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was set in Vercel but not being recognized in production, causing AI analysis to fail.

**Root Cause**: 
- Vercel's serverless environment wasn't consistently providing environment variables
- Possible Edge Runtime vs Node.js runtime conflicts
- Singleton pattern preventing fresh environment variable reads

**Solution**:
- Created `ClaudeClientProduction` with multiple detection methods:
  - Standard `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - Alternative with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
  - Search through ALL env vars for valid Anthropic keys
  - Dynamic evaluation as last resort
- Added automatic fallback in `ComprehensiveAnalyzer`
- Force Node.js runtime with `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`

### 2. **Mock Analysis TypeScript Fix** (Commit: `18f1686`)
**Problem**: Build failure due to incorrect property reference in mock analysis.

**Root Cause**: 
- Mock analysis was accessing `clientData.clientProfile`
- The `ClientDataAggregate` interface actually has `personalInfo` property

**Solution**:
- Changed `clientData.clientProfile` to `clientData.personalInfo`
- Aligned mock analysis with correct interface structure

### 3. **Private Storage Bucket Resolution** (Commits: multiple)
**Problem**: PDF viewer showed empty despite successful uploads - "Bucket not found" errors.

**Root Cause**:
- Supabase storage bucket `lab-files` was set to private
- URLs were being constructed for public access
- Mismatch between expected public URLs and actual private bucket

**Solution**:
- Created diagnostic endpoints to check bucket status
- Implemented smart URL generation:
  - Use direct URLs for public buckets
  - Generate signed URLs for private buckets
- Created `/api/final-fix` endpoint that auto-detects and handles both cases

### 4. **Document Display System Fix** (Multiple commits)
**Problem**: Documents showing "0" count, viewer not appearing, incorrect URLs.

**Root Cause**:
- Database schema mismatch (`file_path` vs `file_url` columns)
- Hardcoded incorrect Supabase URLs in fix scripts
- Files uploaded to wrong storage paths

**Solution**:
- Simplified to use only `file_url` column consistently
- Updated all endpoints to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- Created proper upload endpoint with correct path structure
- Enhanced PDF viewer component with better error handling

### 5. **ClaudeClient Singleton Pattern Removal** (Commit: `e44634c`)
**Problem**: Claude client not picking up environment variables in serverless environment.

**Root Cause**:
- Singleton pattern was caching the client instance
- First initialization happened without environment variables loaded
- Subsequent requests used the cached instance without API key

**Solution**:
- Modified `getInstance()` to always return `new ClaudeClient()`
- Ensures fresh environment variable reads on each request
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
