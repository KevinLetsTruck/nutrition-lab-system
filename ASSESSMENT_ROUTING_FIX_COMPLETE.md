# Assessment Routing Fix Complete ✅

## Problem Solved

The issue where `/assessment/new` immediately showed "Assessment Complete!" has been fixed.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Assessment Creation Logic**

- Updated `/api/assessment` endpoint to handle test client creation
- Now properly creates new assessments with status "IN_PROGRESS"
- Returns first question from the template

### 2. **Assessments Page** (`/assessments`)

- Changed from routing to `/assessment/new` to directly creating assessments
- "New Assessment" button now:
  - Creates a new assessment via API
  - Navigates to `/assessment/[id]` with the new ID
  - Handles existing active assessments gracefully

### 3. **Assessment Page Logic** (`/assessment/[id]/page.tsx`)

- Fixed condition to only show "Complete" when:
  - There's no current question AND
  - Not in loading state AND
  - Has a valid assessment ID
- Shows error message if unable to start assessment

### 4. **API Endpoints**

- `/api/assessment` (POST) - Creates new assessments
- Automatically creates test client if needed
- Returns assessment ID and first question

## How to Test

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/assessments
2. Click "New Assessment" button
3. If no active assessment exists:
   - Creates new assessment
   - Redirects to `/assessment/[id]`
   - Shows first question (energy level)
4. If active assessment exists:
   - Shows prompt to continue existing assessment
   - Can navigate to existing assessment

## Current Status

- ✅ New assessments create properly
- ✅ First question displays correctly
- ✅ No more immediate "Assessment Complete!"
- ✅ Handles existing assessments gracefully
- ✅ Test client auto-creation works

## Test Results

- Assessment ID: `cmeqfskjz0002v2ot879gulct`
- Status: `IN_PROGRESS`
- Module: `SCREENING`
- First Question: "Rate your overall energy level throughout the day"
- Total Questions: 59

The routing logic is now working correctly!
