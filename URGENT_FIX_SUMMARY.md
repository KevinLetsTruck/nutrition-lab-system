# Urgent Fix Summary: File Storage and API Parameter Mismatch

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ API Parameter Mismatch (FIXED)
**Problem:** The `/api/analyze` endpoint expected `labReportId` but was receiving `filename`

**Solution:** Updated `src/components/ui/file-upload-section.tsx` to send the correct parameter:
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
  labReportId: fileResult.labReportId,  // Changed from filename
  clientEmail: clientInfo.email,
  clientFirstName: clientInfo.firstName,
  clientLastName: clientInfo.lastName
})
```

### 2. ✅ File Storage Retrieval (FIXED)
**Problem:** Files uploaded to Supabase Storage couldn't be retrieved during analysis

**Root Cause:** Files were being uploaded to the `general` bucket but the code was looking in `lab-files` bucket

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. Updated `determineBucketFromPath()` in `/src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` to default to `general` bucket
2. Added fallback logic to try multiple buckets if file not found in primary bucket
3. Enhanced logging to track file retrieval attempts

## Key Code Changes

### `/src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`
- Modified `determineBucketFromPath()` to return 'general' as default bucket
- Added multi-bucket fallback logic in file retrieval section
- Enhanced error logging for better debugging

### `/src/components/ui/file-upload-section.tsx`
- Changed API call to send `labReportId` instead of `filename`

## Verification Steps

1. **Upload Process:**
   - File uploads to Supabase Storage (general bucket)
   - Database record created with file path
   - `labReportId` returned in response

2. **Analysis Process:**
   - Frontend sends `labReportId` to `/api/analyze`
   - API retrieves file path from database
   - File downloaded from storage (tries general bucket first, then others)
   - Analysis performed on file content

## Testing Results

Debug script (`scripts/debug-storage-retrieval.js`) confirmed:
- ✅ Recent files are in `general` bucket, not `lab-files`
- ✅ Older files may be in `lab-files` bucket
- ✅ Storage buckets are accessible with proper permissions

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Bucket Usage:** Consider updating upload logic to use consistent buckets based on file type
2. **Migration Script:** May need to migrate existing files from `general` to appropriate buckets
3. **Frontend Testing:** Test the complete flow through the UI to ensure fixes work end-to-end
4. **Monitoring:** Add monitoring to track storage retrieval failures in production

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to production
2. Monitor error logs for any remaining storage issues
3. Consider implementing a bucket migration strategy for better organization
