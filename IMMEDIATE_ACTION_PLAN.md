# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Upload says "successful" 
- ‚ùå Documents show (0)
- ‚úÖ Buttons now work (will show "coming soon" messages)

## üîç What's Happening:
The upload is saving files, but they're not showing because of **ID mismatches**:
- Your client ID in the URL: `336ac9e9-dda3-477f-89d5-241df47b8745`
- The upload might be using a different ID
- Lab reports are linked to the wrong ID

## üìã Action Steps (Do These Now):

### 1. Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for these logs when you refresh the page:
```
[CLIENT-DASHBOARD] Fetching lab reports for clientId: ...
[CLIENT-DASHBOARD] Initial lab reports query: ...
[CLIENT-DASHBOARD] Debug IDs: ...
```
**Copy these logs and share them!**

### 2. After Deployment (2-3 mins), Visit These URLs:

#### A. System Test:
```
https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/api/test-system
```
**Share the JSON response**

#### B. Client Debug (replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID):
```
https://nutrition-lab-system-lets-truck.vercel.app/api/debug-client?id=336ac9e9-dda3-477f-89d5-241df47b8745
```
**This will show:**
- Where your client data actually is
- What lab reports exist
- What files were uploaded

### 3. Check Supabase Dashboard
Run this SQL query:
```sql
-- Find all references to your client
SELECT 'clients' as table_name, id, email, first_name, last_name 
FROM clients 
WHERE email LIKE '%kevin%' OR id = '336ac9e9-dda3-477f-89d5-241df47b8745'

UNION ALL

SELECT 'users' as table_name, id, email, '' as first_name, '' as last_name
FROM users 
WHERE email LIKE '%kevin%'

UNION ALL

SELECT 'lab_reports' as table_name, id, client_id as email, report_type as first_name, file_path as last_name
FROM lab_reports
WHERE client_id = '336ac9e9-dda3-477f-89d5-241df47b8745'
OR client_id IN (SELECT id FROM clients WHERE email LIKE '%kevin%')
OR client_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%kevin%');
```

## üéØ Quick Fix While We Debug:
Try uploading a file and then **refresh the page** - sometimes the UI doesn't update immediately.

## üí° What I Suspect:
1. The client ID `336ac9e9...` exists in the `users` table (not `clients`)
2. Lab reports are being created with a different client ID
3. The page is looking in the wrong table

**Share the debug results and we'll fix this immediately!**
