# Daily Research Log - January 25, 2025

**Research Track**: Advanced AI Features & NutriQ Integration  
**Phase**: Week 1 - Foundation & Analysis  
**Session**: Sprint Setup & NutriQ Pipeline Start

## **🎯 Session Objectives**
- [✅] Implement comprehensive workflow system
- [🔄] Begin NutriQ Data Analysis Pipeline
- [⏳] Create database schema for historical data
- [⏳] Design Claude analysis prompts

## **⚡ Real-Time Progress Log**

### **[Chat Start] Context Restoration**
- ✅ Read master project documents
- ✅ Confirmed research track focus (12-week timeline)  
- ✅ Validated system health (database, git, memory)
- ✅ Identified current phase: Foundation & Analysis

### **[Next] Workflow Implementation**
- ✅ Created `/docs/` directory structure
- ✅ Created `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` with specific objectives
- ✅ Created `daily-logs/` and `research-findings/` directories
- 🔄 **ACTIVE**: Implementing workflow system

### **[COMPLETED] NutriQ Database Schema**
- ✅ Design tables for historical NutriQ assessments
- ✅ Create question mapping and normalization schema  
- ✅ Build data validation and cleansing structure
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Database migration with 6 tables created
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Performance indexes for fast queries
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: 15 functional medicine conditions seeded

### **[COMPLETED] NutriQ Assessment Analysis**
- ✅ 3 complete assessments analyzed (Corbin Moore, Thomas Brooks, Donald Kronner)
- ✅ 321-question structure mapped and documented
- ✅ Scoring methodology reverse-engineered 
- ✅ 19 functional categories identified
- ✅ Condition prioritization system understood
- ✅ Comprehensive analysis report generated

### **[READY] SimpleAssessment Enhancement Plan**
- 🎯 **NEXT**: Apply NutriQ insights to enhance existing 80-question system
- ⏳ Map existing questions to NutriQ categories
- ⏳ Implement percentage-based condition scoring
- ⏳ Add visual symptom burden reporting

## **🧠 Key Insights Discovered**

### **Workflow Insights**
- Documentation-driven development prevents context loss
- Real-time progress tracking enables seamless handoffs
- Memory system + git + docs creates bulletproof continuity

### **Technical Architecture**
- Current SimpleAssessment model provides solid foundation
- Claude API integration operational for pattern analysis
- PostgreSQL supports complex relationships needed for research

## **⚠️ Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: None currently  
**Blockers**: None currently  
**Risk Factors**: Need to validate NutriQ data format before schema design  

## **📋 Next Session Handoff**

**Status**: Workflow system operational, beginning NutriQ implementation  
**Next Immediate Task**: Create NutriQ database schema design  
**Context**: Research track, Week 1 Foundation phase, full innovation freedom  
**Files to Review**: `/docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.md`
