# BULLETPROOF PROJECT WORKFLOW SYSTEM\n\n**Purpose**: Prevent repeated project failures through structured decision-making and reality validation\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW PROCESS\n\n### PHASE 1: SESSION INITIALIZATION (Every New Chat)\n\n#### Step 1: Reality Check (5 minutes)\n```\n□ Read CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md (single focus file)\n□ Verify system health: database, git, dependencies\n□ Confirm current session has ONE clear objective\n□ Validate objective is achievable in current session\n□ Check for blockers or dependencies\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Scope Protection\n```\n□ Write down session objective on paper/notes\n□ Set 2-hour maximum session time\n□ Identify exactly what \"done\" looks like\n□ List maximum 3 tasks for this session\n□ Commit to NO scope changes without formal evaluation\n```\n\n### PHASE 2: EXECUTION CONTROL\n\n#### Step 3: Controlled Development (Every 30 minutes)\n```\n□ CHECKPOINT: Are we still working on original objective?\n□ If diverged: STOP immediately\n□ Document why divergence occurred\n□ Use Change Evaluation Framework (below)\n□ Either return to objective or formally change scope\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Change Evaluation Framework\n**When new information suggests scope change:**\n\n```\nCHANGE REQUEST EVALUATION:\n\n1. IMPACT ANALYSIS\n   □ Will this change achieve session objective faster?\n   □ Does this eliminate the need for current objective?\n   □ What is the cost of stopping current work?\n   □ Can current objective be modified instead of abandoned?\n\n2. REALITY CHECK\n   □ Can new scope be completed in remaining session time?\n   □ Do we have required information/resources?\n   □ Is this change based on complete information?\n   □ Are we making emotional vs logical decision?\n\n3. DECISION CRITERIA\n   ✅ PROCEED WITH CHANGE IF:\n   - New scope eliminates need for original objective\n   - Change can be completed in current session\n   - Based on new factual information (not assumptions)\n   \n   ❌ REJECT CHANGE IF:\n   - Original objective still valid and achievable\n   - New scope increases session time >2x\n   - Based on incomplete information\n   - This is 3rd scope change in project\n\n4. FORMAL DOCUMENTATION\n   □ Update CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md with change and rationale\n   □ Document abandoned work and reason\n   □ Set new realistic completion criteria\n```\n\n### PHASE 3: SESSION COMPLETION\n\n#### Step 5: Mandatory Session Closure\n```\n□ Did we complete stated objective? Yes/No\n□ If No: What prevented completion?\n□ What exactly was accomplished?\n□ What is the SINGLE next objective for next session?\n□ Are there any blockers for next session?\n□ Commit all work with descriptive message\n□ Update CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md for next session\n```\n\n## FAILURE PREVENTION MECHANISMS\n\n### Mechanism 1: Single Focus Rule\n**CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md contains exactly ONE objective at all times**\n\nFormat:\n```markdown\n# CURRENT OBJECTIVE\n\n**Session Goal**: [Single, measurable objective]\n**Success Criteria**: [Exactly what \"done\" looks like]\n**Time Estimate**: [Realistic completion time]\n**Dependencies**: [What must be available/working]\n**Exit Criteria**: [When to stop/pivot]\n\n**NOT DOING**: [List related tasks we're NOT doing this session]\n```\n\n### Mechanism 2: Scope Protection Protocol\n```\nSCOPE CHANGE TRIGGERS:\n- \"While we're at it, let's also...\"\n- \"This would be easy to add...\"\n- \"I just realized we should...\"\n- \"Since we're here, why don't we...\"\n\nIMMEDIATE RESPONSE:\n1. STOP current work\n2. Write down the suggestion\n3. Evaluate using Change Framework\n4. Make explicit decision\n5. Document decision rationale\n```\n\n### Mechanism 3: Reality Validation Checkpoints\n**Every 30 minutes:**\n```\n□ Are we on track to complete objective in estimated time?\n□ If behind: What's causing delay?\n□ Should we reduce scope or extend timeline?\n□ Are we building what was actually requested?\n```\n\n### Mechanism 4: Failure Pattern Recognition\n```\nCOMMON FAILURE PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR:\n\n1. \"Feature Creep\" - Adding \"just one more thing\"\n   Prevention: Strict adherence to Single Focus Rule\n   \n2. \"Perfect Solution\" - Over-engineering first version\n   Prevention: Define minimum viable completion criteria\n   \n3. \"Research Rabbit Hole\" - Endless analysis without building\n   Prevention: Set maximum research time (30 minutes)\n   \n4. \"Context Switching\" - Jumping between multiple objectives\n   Prevention: Physical note with current objective visible\n   \n5. \"Shiny Object\" - New ideas derail current work\n   Prevention: \"Idea Parking Lot\" - document but don't pursue\n```\n\n## CRITICAL RULES\n\n### Rule 1: One Objective Per Session\n- CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md can only contain one active goal\n- No exceptions for \"quick tasks\" or \"while we're here\"\n- Related tasks go in BACKLOG.md, not current session\n\n### Rule 2: 2-Hour Session Maximum  \n- Longer sessions lead to poor decisions and scope creep\n- If objective can't be completed in 2 hours, break it down\n- Force regular breaks for perspective and evaluation\n\n### Rule 3: Explicit Change Approval\n- All scope changes must pass Change Evaluation Framework\n- Document rationale for every change decision\n- Track pattern of changes to identify recurring issues\n\n### Rule 4: Completion Over Perfection\n- Define \"minimum viable completion\" for each objective\n- Ship working version before optimizing\n- Perfect is the enemy of done\n\n### Rule 5: No Emotional Decision Making\n- When frustrated/excited: take 5-minute break\n- Evaluate decisions based on written criteria, not feelings\n- Consult Change Framework for all major decisions\n\n## ESCALATION PROCEDURES\n\n### When Objective Can't Be Completed\n```\nSTEP 1: Diagnose the problem\n□ Was objective unrealistic?\n□ Did unexpected blockers arise?\n□ Did scope creep occur?\n□ Was information incomplete?\n\nSTEP 2: Make explicit decision\n□ Reduce scope to achievable subset\n□ Extend timeline with specific completion plan\n□ Abandon objective with documented rationale\n□ Change objective based on new information\n\nSTEP 3: Update documentation\n□ Record what was learned\n□ Update CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md\n□ Note patterns for future prevention\n```\n\n### When Multiple Failures Occur\n```\nIf 3 sessions in a row fail to complete objectives:\n1. STOP all development work\n2. Conduct failure analysis session\n3. Review and revise workflow process\n4. Consider external consultation\n5. Don't resume until root cause identified\n```\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST\n\n### To Start Using This System:\n```\n□ Create CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md with single current goal\n□ Create BACKLOG.md for future objectives\n□ Create DECISION_LOG.md for tracking scope changes\n□ Print this workflow and keep visible during sessions\n□ Commit to following process for next 5 sessions\n□ Evaluate and refine system based on results\n```\n\n### Daily Workflow Checklist:\n```\n□ Read CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md\n□ Confirm objective is achievable today\n□ Set 2-hour maximum session time\n□ Work only on stated objective\n□ Complete 30-minute reality checks\n□ Use Change Framework for any scope questions\n□ Update CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md before ending session\n```\n\nThis system prioritizes CONSISTENT FORWARD PROGRESS over perfect solutions or comprehensive features. The goal is to build momentum through completed objectives rather than getting stuck in planning or scope expansion cycles.
