# PDF Processing Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Why We Recommend Images Over PDFs

For **90% of medical lab reports**, uploading as **high-quality images** provides better accuracy than PDF text extraction.

## âœ… Best Practice Workflow

### For PDF Lab Reports:

1. **Open your PDF** on your computer/phone
2. **Take screenshots** of each page containing lab values
   - Use full-screen screenshots
   - Ensure text is crisp and readable
   - Save as JPG or PNG files
3. **Upload the image files** to the system
4. **Our OCR** will extract lab values with 95%+ accuracy

### Alternative for Digital PDFs:

If your PDF has selectable text:

1. Try uploading the PDF first
2. If processing fails, you'll get clear guidance
3. You can copy-paste key lab values into the notes section

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Approach Works Better

- **Higher Accuracy**: Image OCR optimized for lab reports
- **Better Layout Handling**: Preserves table structures
- **No PDF Compatibility Issues**: Works with all lab formats
- **Faster Processing**: Direct image analysis

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

The system will automatically:

1. Detect PDF uploads
2. Provide helpful guidance for optimal processing
3. Process images with advanced OCR
4. Extract lab values using pattern matching
5. Generate functional medicine analysis

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **High Resolution**: Use 300+ DPI for screenshots
- **Good Lighting**: Ensure clear contrast
- **Complete Pages**: Include reference ranges and units
- **Multiple Pages**: Upload each page separately for best results
