# Route Group Conflict Fix

## Issue

The application had duplicate pages that resolved to the same paths:

- `/src/app/login/page.tsx` and `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` both resolved to `/login`
- `/src/app/register/page.tsx` and `/src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` both resolved to `/register`

This caused a Next.js error: "You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path"

## Solution

Removed the duplicate standalone pages and kept only the route group versions:

- Deleted `/src/app/login/page.tsx`
- Deleted `/src/app/register/page.tsx`
- Removed empty directories

## Result

- Authentication pages now properly organized under the `(auth)` route group
- No more path conflicts
- Application loads correctly

## Route Structure

```
src/app/
├── (auth)/
│   ├── layout.tsx       # Auth layout wrapper
│   ├── login/
│   │   └── page.tsx     # Login page
│   └── register/
│       └── page.tsx     # Register page
└── (protected)/
    ├── layout.tsx       # Protected layout wrapper
    └── assessment/
        ├── page.tsx     # Assessment page
        ├── welcome/
        │   └── page.tsx # Welcome landing page
        └── complete/
            └── page.tsx # Completion page
```

The `(auth)` and `(protected)` route groups help organize the codebase without affecting the URL structure.
