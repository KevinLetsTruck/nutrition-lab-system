# 🔬 RESEARCH TRACK - CURRENT SPRINT

**Date**: January 25, 2025  
**Sprint**: Week 1 - Foundation & Analysis  
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Phase**: NutriQ Data Analysis Pipeline Implementation

## **🎯 SPRINT OBJECTIVES**

### **Primary Goal**: Build NutriQ Data Analysis Pipeline
Extract diagnostic patterns from thousands of historical NutriQ assessments to identify:
- Question-outcome correlations
- Highest-value diagnostic indicators  
- Condition-specific symptom clusters
- Mathematical scoring algorithms

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] NutriQ CSV data successfully imported and parsed
- [ ] Claude-powered pattern analysis extracts top 20 questions per condition
- [ ] Statistical correlation analysis identifies diagnostic weights
- [ ] Mathematical scoring algorithms validated against known outcomes

## **📅 TODAY'S OBJECTIVES (January 25, 2025)**

### **Immediate Tasks (Next 4 Hours)**
- [✅] **Create NutriQ database schema** - Tables for historical assessment data
- [🔄] **Build CSV upload system** - Parse and validate NutriQ export format
- [⏳] **Design Claude analysis prompts** - Extract patterns from assessment data
- [⏳] **Test with sample data** - Validate end-to-end pipeline

### **Session Goals (This Chat)**
- [ ] Set up complete workflow documentation system
- [ ] Begin NutriQ database schema design
- [ ] Create first analysis pipeline component
- [ ] Test Claude API integration for pattern recognition

## **⚡ CURRENT STATUS**

**Active Task**: Building practitioner-focused SimpleAssessment enhancements  
**Progress**: ✅ Workflow system, ✅ Database schema, ✅ NutriQ methodology analysis complete  
**Next Step**: Implement percentage-based condition scoring for practitioners  
**Focus**: Clinical diagnostic tool, not client-facing interface  
**Blockers**: None currently  

## **📊 PROGRESS TRACKING**

### **Week 1 Progress**
- [✅] **Project Management System**: COMPLETE
- [🔄] **NutriQ Data Analysis Pipeline**: IN PROGRESS (40%)
  - [✅] Workflow documentation system
  - [✅] Database schema design & implementation
  - [🔄] CSV upload system
  - [⏳] Pattern analysis engine
  - [⏳] Correlation algorithms

### **Technical Foundation Status**
- ✅ Database: PostgreSQL connected (18 tables operational)
- ✅ Infrastructure: Next.js + Claude API integrated
- ✅ Current System: 80-question assessment working (4 completed assessments)
- ✅ Memory System: Claude memory operational
- ✅ Git: recovery-stable branch, clean state

## **🧠 KEY INSIGHTS THIS SESSION**

### **Breakthrough Discoveries**
- Dual-track strategy successfully prevents "renovation while living" problem
- Current 80-question system provides solid foundation for research
- SimpleAssessment model can be extended for NutriQ analysis
- Claude memory system + documentation prevents context loss

### **Technical Decisions Made**
- Focus on research track only (production handled by Cursor separately)
- Build on existing SimpleAssessment foundation
- Use Claude API for pattern recognition and correlation analysis
- Implement comprehensive workflow to prevent past failures

## **🔄 WORKFLOW CHECKPOINTS**

### **Last Checkpoint**: 2025-01-25 [Chat Start]
- **Completed**: Workflow system implementation
- **Current Task**: Beginning NutriQ database schema design
- **Next Step**: Create tables for historical NutriQ data
- **Context**: Research track focus, 12-week timeline, foundation phase

### **Next Checkpoint**: [30 minutes from now]
- **Target**: Complete NutriQ database schema design
- **Success Metric**: Tables created and validated
- **Handoff Note**: Ready to begin CSV upload system

## **📋 SESSION HANDOFF INFO**

### **For Next Chat/Context Switch**
**Immediate Context**: We are implementing the NutriQ Data Analysis Pipeline as part of Week 1 Foundation phase. The workflow system is now operational.

**Current Work**: Creating database schema for NutriQ historical data analysis.

**Files Modified This Session**:
- Created: `/docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` (this file)
- Created: `/docs/daily-logs/` directory structure
- Next: Will modify Prisma schema for NutriQ tables

**Critical Context**: We're in research track only. Production track is handled separately by Cursor. Full innovation freedom for advanced AI features.

**Next Session Start**: Read this file + PROJECT_STATE.md, then continue with NutriQ database schema implementation.
