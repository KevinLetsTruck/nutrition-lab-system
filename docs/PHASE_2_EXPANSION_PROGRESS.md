## Technical Updates

### ‚úÖ Scale Additions

- Added new `severity` scale for symptom intensity:
  - Very Mild ‚Üí Mild ‚Üí Moderate ‚Üí Severe ‚Üí Very Severe

### ‚úÖ API Updates

- Updated validation: Questions 1-50 (was 1-40)
- Updated completion check: 50 responses (was 40)
- Updated progress calculations to show X/50

### ‚úÖ UI Updates

- Changed text to "Answer 50 quick questions" (was 40)

## Testing Results

### ‚úÖ All Systems Working

- Question structure validated
- API endpoints accept questions 1-50
- Progress correctly shows 58% when 29/50 answered
- Category calculations handle both 5 and 10 question categories

## Next Steps (Remaining Categories)

### üìã Step 2: Sleep & Stress (Questions 21-40)

- Sleep: Add 5 more questions (currently 21-25)
- Stress: Add 5 more questions (currently 26-30)

### üìã Step 3: Immune & Hormonal (Questions 41-60)

- Immune: Add 5 more questions (currently 31-35)
- Hormonal: Add 5 more questions (currently 36-40)

- Detox: Add 5 more questions (currently 41-45)
- Cardiovascular: Add 5 more questions (currently 46-50)

## Design Patterns Established

### Question Themes for Expansion:

1. **Severity & Intensity**: How severe/intense when symptoms occur
2. **Temporal Patterns**: When symptoms typically happen
3. **Triggers & Patterns**: What makes symptoms worse
4. **Recovery & Management**: How quickly you bounce back
5. **Functional Impact**: How symptoms affect daily life

### Scale Usage:

- `frequencyReverse`: 17 questions (negative symptoms)
- `quality`: 11 questions (how well something works)
- `level`: 12 questions (intensity/amount)
- `consistency`: 4 questions (stability over time)
- `severity`: 1 question (symptom intensity)
- Other scales: regularity, satisfaction, energy, ease

## Progress Summary

- **Goal**: 80 questions (10 per category)
- **Current**: 50 questions (2 categories expanded, 6 to go)
- **Completion**: 25% of expansion complete
- **Next Milestone**: Expand Sleep & Stress categories

The gradual expansion strategy continues to work perfectly, maintaining system stability while adding depth to the assessment!
