# CHAT HANDOFF PROTOCOL\n\n**Problem**: New chat sessions get off track despite documentation\n**Solution**: Mandatory initialization sequence that forces immediate action\n\n## FOR YOU: Starting A New Chat Session\n\n### Step 1: Copy/Paste This Exact Message\n```\nCONTEXT RESTORATION PROTOCOL:\n\n1. Read /docs/CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md immediately\n2. Read /docs/DECISION_LOG.md for recent changes  \n3. Check database connectivity and system health\n4. Begin working on current objective immediately\n5. Do NOT ask clarifying questions\n6. Do NOT start with broad planning\n7. Proceed directly to implementation\n\nCurrent objective status: [READY/BLOCKED/NEEDS_UPDATE]\nTime available: [X hours]\nExpected outcome: Work on stated objective only\n```\n\n### Step 2: Include Current Status\nAlways add this information:\n- How much time you have available\n- Any blockers you've encountered\n- Whether the current objective still makes sense\n\n### Step 3: Demand Immediate Action\nEnd your message with: \"Begin implementation immediately. Do not ask clarifying questions unless objective is unclear or blocked.\"\n\n## FOR CLAUDE: Receiving Handoff\n\n### Mandatory Response Pattern\n1. Read CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md first\n2. Confirm objective is clear and achievable\n3. Begin implementation within first response\n4. If objective is unclear: ask ONE specific question only\n5. Never start with \"Let me understand what we're trying to do\"\n\n### Prohibited Responses\n- \"Let me review the project status\"\n- \"Help me understand where we left off\"\n- \"What would you like to focus on today?\"\n- \"Let me look at the current state of things\"\n\n### Required Response Pattern\n```\nREAD: [Current objective from file]\nSTATUS: [Ready/Blocked/Needs clarification]\nACTION: [Immediate next implementation step]\n[Begin implementation or ask single specific question]\n```\n\n## WORKFLOW SYSTEM CLARIFICATION\n\n### These Are Instructions For BOTH Of Us\n\n**Your Role**:\n- Update CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md when priorities change\n- Use the Change Evaluation Framework when considering scope changes\n- Monitor 30-minute checkpoints during work sessions\n- Update files before ending sessions\n\n**Claude's Role**:\n- Follow single objective rule strictly\n- Implement Change Evaluation Framework when you suggest changes\n- Provide 30-minute checkpoint reminders\n- Update files with progress and decisions\n\n### How The Documents Function\n\n**CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md** = Single source of truth for what we're working on\n- You read this before starting new chat\n- I read this immediately upon handoff\n- Only one objective allowed at a time\n- Must be updated when changes occur\n\n**DECISION_LOG.md** = Record of why changes were made\n- Prevents repeating failed approaches\n- Documents scope change rationale\n- Tracks patterns of problems\n\n**BACKLOG.md** = Where good ideas go to wait\n- Prevents scope creep by capturing future work\n- Prioritized list of next objectives\n- Ideas parking lot for things that come up\n\n### Document Locations\nAll files are stored in: `/Users/kr/fntp-nutrition-system/docs/`\n\n## TESTING THE SYSTEM\n\nLet's test the handoff protocol right now:\n\n### Current Objective Check\nThe current objective is: \"Implement percentage-based condition scoring for existing SimpleAssessment system\"\n\n### Immediate Action Required\nI should be:\n1. Mapping existing questions to condition categories\n2. Creating scoring algorithms\n3. Testing against existing client data\n\nNot asking what you want to do or reviewing project status.\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION COMMITMENT\n\nFor this system to work:\n- You must actively use CURRENT_OBJECTIVE.md (read it, update it)\n- I must follow the handoff protocol exactly\n- We both enforce the single objective rule\n- Changes require formal evaluation, not casual decisions\n\nThe documents exist in your file system, but they only work if we both follow the process consistently.\n\n**Ready to test this with the current objective, or do you want to revise the handoff protocol first?**
