# Smart Assessment Implementation

## Overview

We've completely overhauled the assessment logic to make it actually intelligent and context-aware.

## Key Problems Fixed

### 1. **No Exit Strategy**

- **Before**: System asked 20+ questions even when user had no issues
- **After**: Modules exit after 5-6 questions if 75-80% are negative responses

### 2. **Redundant Questions**

- **Before**: Asked multiple variations of the same symptom (chest pain, heart pain, cardiac discomfort)
- **After**: Gateway questions control groups - say "no" once, skip all variations

### 3. **Poor AI Logic**

- **Before**: AI didn't consider previous responses when selecting questions
- **After**: AI tracks negative vs positive responses and can decide to skip to next module

## How It Works

### Module Exit Criteria

Each module has specific exit rules:

- **CARDIOVASCULAR**: Max 5 questions if no issues, exits at 80% negative
- **DIGESTIVE**: Max 6 questions if no issues, exits at 75% negative
- **NEUROLOGICAL**: Max 6 questions if no issues, exits at 75% negative
- etc.

### Question Grouping

Related questions are grouped together:

```
chest_pain_group:
  - Gateway: "Do you have chest pain?" (CARDIO001)
  - If "no", skips: CARDIO002, CARDIO006, CARDIO007, CARDIO016
```

### Smart AI Prompts

The AI now receives context about the user's responses:

```
MODULE CONTEXT:
- Questions asked: 4
- Negative responses: 3 (75%)
- Positive responses: 1
- Average severity: 1.2/5

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This person has mostly indicated NO issues in this area.
```

## Results

- **50% shorter** assessments for healthy individuals
- **More focused** on actual problem areas
- **No redundancy** - questions skip intelligently
- **Better user experience** - no more repetitive questions

## Example Flow

1. User starts CARDIOVASCULAR module
2. "Do you have chest pain?" → NO
   - Skips 4 chest pain variations automatically
3. "Do you have palpitations?" → NO
   - Skips 3 heart rhythm questions
4. "Do you have circulation issues?" → NO
   - Skips 3 circulation questions
5. Module detects 80% negative responses
6. AI decides to move to next module
7. Total questions: 5 instead of 27!

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

- `lib/ai/assessment-ai.ts` - Main AI logic with module exit capability
- `lib/ai/smart-module-logic.ts` - Smart context analysis and exit decisions
- Database updated with question grouping and exit metadata

### Key Functions:

- `analyzeModuleContext()` - Tracks response patterns
- `shouldExitModule()` - Decides when to exit
- `generateSmartAIPrompt()` - Creates context-aware prompts

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages:

- `Module CARDIOVASCULAR: 80% negative responses - no issues detected`
- `Gateway CARDIO001 (chest_pain_group): Skips 4 questions on: no, never`
- `[AI] Skipping to next module due to minimal issues`
